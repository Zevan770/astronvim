--- Guess value of 'background' based on terminal color.
---
--- We write Operating System Command (OSC) 11 to the terminal to request the
--- terminal's background color. We then wait for a response. If the response
--- matches `rgba:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB/AAAA` where R, G, B, and A are hex digits, then
--- compute the luminance[1] of the RGB color and classify it as light/dark
--- accordingly. Note that the color components may have anywhere from one to
--- four hex digits, and require scaling accordingly as values out of 4, 8, 12,
--- or 16 bits. Also note the A(lpha) component is optional, and is parsed but
--- ignored in the calculations.

do
--- Parse a string of hex characters as a color.
---
--- The string can contain 1 to 4 hex characters. The returned value is
--- between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive) representing the intensity of the color.
---
--- For instance, if only a single hex char "a" is used, then this function
--- returns 0.625 (10 / 16), while a value of "aa" would return 0.664 (170 /
--- 256).

--- @return number? Intensity of the color

---   OSC 11 ; rgba:<red>/<green>/<blue>/<alpha>
---
--- where
---
---   <red>, <green>, <blue>, <alpha> := h | hh | hhh | hhhh
---
--- The alpha component is ignored, if present.

--- @return string? Red component
